# Stable Diffusion Video Generative Models Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to set up the Stable Diffusion Video Generative Models repository using two different methods: a Batch file for Windows users and a Python script for cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, and Linux).

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:

-   Git
-   Python (3.6 or newer)
-   pip (Python package installer)

## Method 1: Using Batch File (Windows Only)

### Step 1: Download the Batch File

Download the `install-sd-video.bat` file from the repository.

### Step 2: Run the Batch File

Double-click on the `install-sd-video.bat` file to run it. This script will do the following for you **automatically**:

-   Clone the generative-models repository
-   Download necessary files and scripts
-   Create a Python virtual environment
-   Install required dependencies
-   Prepare the system to run the Streamlit application

### Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

After the script execution, navigate to the repository's root directory and activate the virtual environment:

bashCopy code

`cd generative-models
venv\Scripts\activate` 

### Step 4: Run the Application

With the virtual environment activated, start the Streamlit application:

arduinoCopy code

`streamlit run video_sampling.py` 

## Method 2: Using Python Script (Cross-Platform)

### Step 1: Download the Python Script

Download the `install-sd-video.py` file from the repository.

### Step 2: Run the Python Script

Execute the script using Python:

Copy code

`python install-sd-video.py` 

This script performs similar tasks as the batch file but is compatible with multiple operating systems.

### Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

After the script execution, follow the printed instructions to activate the virtual environment and install the required dependencies.

### Step 4: Run the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, start the Streamlit application:

arduinoCopy code

`streamlit run video_sampling.py` 

## Troubleshooting
**Note** : Some folks have issues with the download of huggingface models, if you want to manually download the models yourself, you can comment you the following lines in the bat or python files:
* Batch: Lines 18-22
* Python: Lines 25 to 35

  
If you encounter any issues during the installation or execution process, ensure all prerequisites are correctly installed and up-to-date. For further assistance, consult the official documentation or reach out to the support community.
